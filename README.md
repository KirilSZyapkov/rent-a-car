Reflection

This project was for my first exam in Softuni with React JS.

I wanted to build a website that give the opertunity, everybody to post freely their cars for rent and to earn money.

The challenge in this project is that it is my firs Full-Stack App that includes both FRONT-END FRAMEWORK and FRONT-END FRAMEWORK.

During the project, I encountered obstacles that I would not have thought existed such as how my app will react when server is dow, how to implement google map, how user to add social media when in register form it's not included.

For this project i used React JS for the front-end and Node JS for the server.

This was a 2 month long project built during my third module at JS Web Module in Softuni. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 5.0, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
